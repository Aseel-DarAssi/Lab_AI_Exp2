# Experiment 2: Data Visualization, Cleaning, and Feature Selection

This experiment focuses on discussing concepts and techniques used for **data cleaning** and **feature selection** as part of an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**. EDA plays a crucial role in understanding and examining datasets. Throughout the experiment, exercises are included to strengthen comprehension and practical skills.

## Topics Covered

### 1️ Data Visualization
Visualizing data helps identify patterns, trends, and outliers.

- **Using Matplotlib:** Basic plots for data analysis  
- **Using Seaborn:** Advanced statistical visualizations  
- **Boxplot:** Visualizing distributions and detecting outliers  

### 2️ Descriptive Statistics
Summarizes and describes key aspects of data.

- **Central Tendency:** Mean, median, mode  
- **Variation:** Range, variance, standard deviation  
- **Shape of Distribution:** Skewness, kurtosis  
- **Quantiles:** Dividing data into intervals for analysis  

### 3️ Handling Missing Data
Missing data can impact analysis and model accuracy.

- **Dropping missing data:** Removing rows or columns with missing values  
- **Imputation:** Replacing missing values with mean, median, mode, or other strategies  

### 4️ Handling Outliers
Outliers can distort data analysis and model results.

- **Detecting Outliers:** Using interquartile range (IQR) and boxplots  
- **Statistical Detection:** Using Z-Score to identify anomalies  
- **Handling Outliers:** Removing or transforming detected outliers  

### 5️ Feature Selection
Selecting the most relevant features improves model performance and reduces complexity.

- **Filtering Method using Variance:** Removing features with low variance  
- **Filtering Method using Information Gain:** Selecting features that contribute most to the target variable
